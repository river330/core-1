         <p class="answer">I think the biggest lesson I learned from foundation year was <mark>it's okay to fail.</mark> For example, I always wanted to have my own art account but was always too scared to do it. I named my current one "Make Shit Happen" as a double entendre. On one hand, it means to will something to existence through conscious effort. On the other, it means to literally "make shit" as in ugly, useless pieces. I think discovering and owning this mindset was a result of foundation year, as most teachers put an emphasis on experimentation.</p>

         <p class="answer">I grew up as a <mark>black sheep</mark> in my family --- they're all business people. No one around me really took the time to listen to me and I think art was a way to make people do that.

          <p class="emp q2">There's this quote that really resonated with me:</p>
          <p class="ref">“Because—how do you explain that it is never inspiration that drives you to tell a story, but rather a combination of anger and clarity?"* But something else I learned was even if people see you, it doesn't mean they'll understand you. Sometimes people can't change the lens they view you through.<br><br>*Valeria Luiselli, Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in 40 Questions</p>

         <p class="answer">I definitely work better under pressure. It's how I've got things done my whole life but I'm beginning to realize it's not a sustainable method. <br><br>As for actual designing, it really depends. Sometimes I instantly know how I want something to look, and other times I need to do a bit of research before I figure out what I'm going to do. When it's the latter, I start by defining the goal of the project --- what do I want to achieve, who is this for? Once I get it down in words I proceed to match the concept/s with relevant visuals. <br><br>Then comes the fun part. <mark>I like to sit in a place where I'll be undisturbed and work for long stretches of time.</mark> Illustrator is my go-to software but I'll use Photoshop when the need arises.</p>

         <p class="answer">My senior thesis project, <mark>"Chino Ka".</mark> In hindsight there were a lot of things that could've been done better but I learned a lot from it. It was a medium to <mark>explore questions I've always asked myself,</mark> and asking them in public allowed me to meet people with the same curiosities. A lot of Chinese Filipino in my school approached me and my partner to talk about their experiences growing up Chinese in the Philippines. It was probably the project that made me think I really wanted to go for communication design.</p>
